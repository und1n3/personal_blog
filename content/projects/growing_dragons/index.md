Thisproject started with the Godot Wild Jam idea and wildcards [see the link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). However, as I didn't quite finish during the jam period, here I find myself, trying to finish something at least.

# Growing Dragons
## Game Idea 

bla bla bla

### Egg Types
Will add around 10 eggs altough 6 are enough to complete the game
| Egg name | Condition |
|:---------|:---------|
| **Infinity Egg** | Pausing the game fo more than 20 seconds. | 
| **Crimson Egg**  | From mixing red ingredients/crops:  | 
| **Hermit Egg** | Never accepting NPC's help, refusing to all  the secondary missions. |
| **Rebel Egg** | Not reaching the king's goal of N eggs by one egg. Will appear at the end and change the final.|
